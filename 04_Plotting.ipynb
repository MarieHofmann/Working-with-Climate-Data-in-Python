    "\n",
    "Create a **legend** (if there are multiple lines in one plot): `plt.legend()`. The plot will automatically generate a legend for you. If you wish to give other names to your lines, you will need to specify them by giving the `label = 'your_labelname_here'` argument to the plotting method itself. You can change the location of the legend in your plot by giving the optional argument `loc = 'your_location_here'` to the method. Possible locations are e.g.: 'best' (the library will automatically search for a spot in your plot, where there is room for the legend), 'upper right', 'lower left', 'right', 'center', 'lower center', 'center left' and so on. Have a look at the [legend documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html#matplotlib.pyplot.legend) if you want to get more control on your legends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the **style of your line**: By giving the following optional arguments to your `.plot()` method.\n",
    "* **LineStyle**: How your line should look like. Possible values: `-` Solid line, `--` Dashed line, `:` Dotted line, `-.` Dash-dot line. Default = `'-'`.\n",
    "* **LineWidth**: Default = 0.5 points, with point = 1/72 inch = 0.351 mm).\n",
    "* **Color**: Color of the line (given as RGB vector oder as String). Possible string values: `k` black, `r` red, `g` green, `b` blue, `c` cyan, `m` magenta, `y` yellow, `w` white\n",
    "* **Marker**: Markertype. Possible Markertypes e.g.: `+`, `o`, `*`, `.`, `x`, `s` (square), `d` (diamond), `p` (five pointed star). Default = `none`.\n",
    "* **MarkerSize**: Size of marker in points. Default = 6 points.\n",
    "* **MarkerEdgeColor**: Color of marker border.\n",
    "* **MarkerFaceColor**: Color of marker body.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also insert a **grid** into your plot: `plt.grid()`. Change the style of your grid lines by specifying the same style keywords as explained for the lineplot above!\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a **reference line** for better orientation to the plot: `plt.axhline(y)` adds a horizontal line across the axis. y is the position in data coordinates of the horizontal line, by default this is 0. You can add further, optional arguments such as `color`, `linestyle` or `linewidth`, etc. They work in the same manner as explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have also set each of those properties via the `ax.set` syntax that we learned earlier. Anyway, this is an easier way to get the same result: By directly plotting some data, python automatically created an axes for the plot. Since we define our properties directly underneath the plotting command, python knows that we would like to set the properties of the axes we just created, altough we do not concretely formulate that! \n",
